## Hashing Password Data
This C++ program demonstrates a basic implementation of a password storage system using a hash function. It manages user accounts, allowing users to create new accounts, sign in, and change their passwords. The passwords are hashed for storage, initially using a reverse-hash method.

The program also uses a two-dimensional array to store user data.
```console
string data[MAX_ENTRIES][3];
```

## Features
- Create New Account: Users can create a new account with a username and password.
- Sign In: Users can sign in using their username and password.
- Change Password: Users can change their password.

## Setup and Installation
This is a standalone C++ application. If you're using a Mac/Linux system to run the program, add a stdc++.h file.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clion, clang, etc.)
- C++ Standard Library
- A text file named data.txt in the specified directory

Make sure that the path to data.txt in the program matches its location on your system.
