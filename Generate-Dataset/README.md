## Generate Datasets
This generates the datasets for the password hashing applications. It should be used separately to create test data files. The program is able to create three different types of datasets: 100, 1000, and 10000.

### Setup
Simply run the program and it will generate three different dataset files. When finished generating the dataset files, choose one and 'select all', 'copy', and then 'paste', into one of the ```hashing password``` program ```data.txt``` files.
